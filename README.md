You are responsible for understanding Harvard's policies on academic integrity (www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student- conduct/academic-integrity) and how to use sources responsibly. Not knowing the rules, misunderstanding the rules, running out of time, submitting "the wrong draft", or being overwhelmed with multiple demands are not acceptable excuses. There are no excuses for failure to uphold academic integrity.
